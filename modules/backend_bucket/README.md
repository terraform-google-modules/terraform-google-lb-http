# Backend_Bucket


## Purpose

This is a submodule of the terraform-google-lb-http module. It can be used to quickly create a static website using a Google Cloud Storage Bucket as a backend, rather than VMs, services, or NEGs. Using this module will result in the following architecture, which leverages a Cloud Storage Bucket for the website files, GCLB for load balancing, Cloud CDN for content caching, and Cloud DNS for global DNS resolution.
