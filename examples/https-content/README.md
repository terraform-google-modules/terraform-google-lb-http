This example creates an HTTPS load balancer to forward traffic to a custom URL map. The URL map sends traffic to the region closest to you with static assets being served from a Cloud Storage bucket. The TLS key and certificate is generated by Terraform using the [TLS provider](https://www.terraform.io/docs/providers/tls/index.html).

## Change to the example directory

```
[[ `basename $PWD` != https-content ]] && cd examples/https-content
```

## Install Terraform

1. Install Terraform if it is not already installed (visit [terraform.io](https://terraform.io) for other distributions):

```
../terraform-install.sh
```

## Set up the environment

1. Set the project, replace `YOUR_PROJECT` with your project ID:

```
PROJECT=YOUR_PROJECT
```

```
gcloud config set project ${PROJECT}
```

2. Configure the environment for Terraform:

```
[[ $CLOUD_SHELL ]] || gcloud auth application-default login
export GOOGLE_PROJECT=$(gcloud config get-value project)
```

## Run Terraform

```
terraform init
terraform apply
```

## Testing

1. Wait for the load balancer to be provisioned:

```
./test.sh
```

2. Open URL of load balancer in browser:

```
echo http://$(terraform output load-balancer-ip)
```

> You should see the GCP logo and instance details from the group closest to your geographical region.

3. Open URL to route mapped to us-west1 instance group:

```
echo https://${EXTERNAL_IP}/group1/
```

> You should see the GCP logo and instance details from the group in us-west1.

4. Open URL to route mapped to us-central1 instance group:
```
echo https://${EXTERNAL_IP}/group2/
```

> You should see the GCP logo and instance details from the group in us-central1.

5. Open URL to route mapped to us-east1 instance group:

```
echo https://${EXTERNAL_IP}/group3/
```

> You should see the GCP logo and instance details from the group in us-east1.

## Cleanup

1. Remove all resources created by terraform:

```
terraform destroy
```
