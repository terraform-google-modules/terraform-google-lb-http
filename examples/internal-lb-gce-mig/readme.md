The forwarding rules and its dependecies are created as part of `frontend` modules.
The forwarding rule is INTERNAL_MANAGED and can not be accessed on open internet. This example also creates two publicly accessible cloud-run services to access the internal load balancer using the internal ip address of the forwarding rule.
